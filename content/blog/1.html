		<h1>Habits - 2022/8/31</h1>

		<p>
		Build up habits very little by little, but consistently. The idea is that you will have days where your willpower is miniscule. 
		The habit should be easy enough that you know you can do it every day. Assume that failing to do your new habit even once will 
		drastically affect whether you stick with it. Once it becomes second nature, you can build on it, or work on an unrelated habit.<br><br>

		Some examples of small habits:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Go to the gym 2 days a week (and no minimum time you need to stay there)</li>
			<li>Eat a healthy breakfast every day</li>
			<li>Send at least 1 message to a friend a day</li>
			<li>Go outside at least once a day</li>
			<li>Make at least 1 git commit a day</li>
		</ul><br><br>

		<p>
		Maybe your ego doesn’t want to build this slowly, but you will end up being inconsistent, or giving up entirely, otherwise. 
		That said, the scale of your particular habit goals will depend on *you*, but what matters is what you think you can do every day, 
		leaning on the safer side.<br><br>

		Two ideas that might help:<br>
		1. Usually it’s better to do more good things than less bad things<br>
		2. Base habits around actions rather than time spent on it<br><br>

		1.<br>
		I feel there can be many explanations for this. Like that humans like stimulation, so if you reduce your stimulation in a day, 
		you may end up more bored and dissatisfied with your life. On the other hand, if you get enough stimulation in your day, you 
		may simply forget to do certain bad habits. There was one summer where I was so focused on my video games that I essentially 
		ended up dieting as a side effect, and lost some weight. Also don’t underestimate the random utility in certain habits you consider bad. 
		Especially social benefits. Examples like playing video games can be harmless enough. But exceptions may be stuff like smoking, or drinking alcohol. 
		It might be better to go for “less smoking” or “less drinking” in these worse habits, I don’t know.<br><br>

		2:<br>
		If you’re saying you’ll spend at least a certain amount of time on something, you may end up getting distracted with the timing. 
		It’s just harder to track – e.g. you may want to take breaks in between the task. You also discourage increasing efficiency. 
		You wouldn’t complain if you went from spending 10 minutes on a task to 3 minutes achieving the same results. So, instead of 
		“spend at least 30 minutes studying”, do “read 3 pages of this textbook”.<br><br>

		You might find it gets easier to build habits as you ingrain new habits in. This is sort of like a meta-habit. You can also say 
		your self-efficacy increases – your belief in your capacity to achieve your goals. This is all the more reason to start small – 
		remember it’s about making sure you do it each day.<br><br>

		An example of the fruits of this technique is this website. To be honest, I didn’t have much willpower to build this website 
		after the first few days. But you’d be surprised how far you can come adding/changing just 1 thing per day consistently.
