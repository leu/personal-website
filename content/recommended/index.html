		<!-- <h2>Manga</h2>
		<p>My favourite manga is probably Dorohedoro. I love the ugly and chaotic nature of its world and I think the characters and story are very well done.</p>
		<img src="/data/general.png">
		<p>My favourite character is probably Shin. I love his pragmatism - shown in how he still uses a simple claw hammer as his weapon.</p>

		<h2>Game</h2>
		<p>FFXIV has the best community of any game I've played so far. It's also clear that the developers care about the game, with all of the new content and tweaks to the game.</p>

		<p>You can add me; I play in the Crystal data centre in Zalera, and my character's name is River Kael!</p>

		<h2>Human-Centred Computing</h2>
		<p>As with probably quite a few computer people, I like making things that other people use and enjoy. Websites are a good medium to bring value to people, and I choose to focus on webdev professionally.</p>
		<h2>Language</h2>
		<p>I like to dabble in learning new natural languages from time to time, e.g. Japanese, lojban.</p>
		<h2>Current philosophy</h2>
		<p>I think it's important to go out of your way to try new ways of doing things whenever you can. This is how you discover how to be better than you are now. I suppose this links strongly to the scientific method, but in the form of life advice.</p>
		<p>On top of that, pay close attention to what you intuitively think of a decision. Sometimes you already intuitively know if something will lead to worse outcomes, but don't know any other way of doing things. It may be worth thinking of some new idea which you feel roughly neutral about, and trying it out. It can be something small.</p>
