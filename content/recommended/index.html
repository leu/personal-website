		<h2>Manga</h2>
		<p>My favourite manga is probably Dorohedoro. I love the ugly and chaotic nature of its world and I think the characters and story are very well done.</p>
		<img src="/images/general.png">
		<p>My favourite character is probably Shin. I love his pragmatism - shown in how he still uses a simple claw hammer as his weapon.</p>

		<h2>Game</h2>
		<p>FFXIV has the best community of any game I've played so far. It's also clear that the developers care about the game, with all of the new content and tweaks to the game.</p>

		<p>You can add me; I play in the Crystal data centre in Zalera, and my character's name is River Kael!</p>
