		<!-- <h2>Manga</h2>
		<p>My favourite manga is probably Dorohedoro. I love the ugly and chaotic nature of its world and I think the characters and story are very well done.</p>

		<p>My favourite character is probably Shin. I love his pragmatism - shown in how he still uses a simple claw hammer as his weapon.</p>

		<h2>Game</h2>
		<p>FFXIV has the best community of any game I've played so far. It's also clear that the developers care about the game, with all of the new content and tweaks to the game.</p>

		<p>You can add me; I play in the Crystal data centre in Zalera, and my character's name is River Kael!</p>

		<h2>Current philosophy</h2>
		<p>Just put in the effort. I had a long period in my life where I was trying to fix problems in a lazy-smart way. One example is over-sleeping. I kept trying to find ways to make it so easy to wake up early that I could do it without effort every day. But it never worked. In the end I decided to just force myself through will-power to get up on time, which actually lead to success and me feeling good about it. Then I started simply putting in more effort to other things in my life, and surprise surprise, I got rewarded. You naturally get uncomfortable putting effort into something, but ultimately it's rewarding and it makes your life fulfilling.</p>
		<p>I also think it's important to go out of your way to try new ways of doing things whenever you can. This is how you discover how to be better than you are now. I suppose this links strongly to the scientific method, but in the form of life advice.</p>
		<h2>Human-Centred Computing</h2>
		<p>As with probably quite a few computer people, I like making things that other people use and enjoy. Websites are a good medium to bring value to people, and I choose to focus on webdev professionally.</p>
