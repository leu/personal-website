I've recently discovered that sugar and carbs causes my psoriasis, so I've been trying a keto diet and it's effectively stopped my psoriasis entirely. For a while I did UV therapy at home and it did work, but it took a lot of time, was really awkward, and wasnt the best for my skin. I'm really glad I found out that carbs cause my psoriasis - I hope this helps others struggling with this condition.
